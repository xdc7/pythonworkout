Create a dict in which the keys are usernames and the values are passwords, both
represented as strings. Create a tiny login system, in which the user must enter a
username and password; if there is a match, then indicate that the user has successfully
logged in. If not, then refuse them entry. (Note: This is a nice little exercise, but please
never store unencrypted passwords. Itâ€™s a major security risk.)
