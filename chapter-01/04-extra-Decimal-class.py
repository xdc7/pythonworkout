"""
Explore the Decimal class (docs.python.org/3.7/library/decimal.html), which has an alternative floating-point representation that’s as accurate as any decimal number can be. Write a function that takes two strings from the user, turns them into Decimal instances, and then prints the floating-point sum of the user’s two inputs. In other words, make it possible for the user to enter 0.1 and 0.2, and for us to get 0.3 back.
